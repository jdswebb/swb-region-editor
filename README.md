## SWB Region Editor for SWGEmu

The **SWB Region Editor** is a standalone tool for creating and editing regions for SWGEmu. It is based on an old (2018) version of the full SWB editor that I have recovered and polished up due to the utility it provided.

SWB is powered by a custom engine that can parse and render most SWG files effectively.
